                    Many people think that living a life in communion with God,
                    means living deprived of many things. When is it exactly the opposite;
                    They will have gained, along with all things, the One who created them.

                     <h4> Some points to reflect</h4>        
            </header>
        <ul>
            <li>...In the book of Genesis the Lord says: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness Gn.1:26,  
                   God was not alone, and one of the times what Jesus said this,was in the Book of John chapter 17 verse 5:
                    And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>    The desire of God is for men to live in fellowship with Him.  
                    'He who died for us, whether we are awake or asleep, we should live together with Him' 1 Thess. 5:10
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                     'We have nothing to do except believe in His vicarious sacrifice'  
            <br>
                      Truly, truly I say to you, whoever believes in me 'HAS' eternal life John 6:47
            <br>
            <br>
                      Truly, truly I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes in him who sent me 'HAS' eternal life, 
                      and will not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. John 5:24
            <br>
            <br>
                      Whoever believes in the Son 'HAS' eternal life; but whoever does not believe in the Son will not see life, 
                      but the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36  
                      Pay attention to verb tense
            <br>
            
                     
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                    Many say that in this way (Just believe and have eternal life) it would be very easy, without having a new conduct, 
                    without having to leave sin, living a life in the lust of the flesh and of the eyes. 
                    The truth is that those who truly believe with understanding fall in love with the Lord and no longer want to live this way. 
                    Likewise, let us remember the warning and command to Christians by Paul in 1st Corinthians chapter 5:
                    Concerning the man who took his father’s wife; that he should be delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
                    or to death, so that his spirit might be saved on the day of the Lord. Don’t you think that God could act in this way with
                    those who dishonor such salvation?
